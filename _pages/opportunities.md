### Undergraduate Students
The Muscarella Lab welcomes applications from students to participate in microbial ecology research. Please email your resume/CV and a brief statement of what you expect to gain from the research experience to [Dr. Mario Muscarella](mailto:memuscarella@alaska.edu?subject=Muscarella Lab Opportunities). Successful undergraduate candidates will be self-motivated, eager, and curious about the scientific process.

Postdocs
I have interdisciplinary proposals submitted and will continue to submit proposals that would fund postdocs to work on microbial ecology topics in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. I am also willing to collaborate on proposals with prospective postdocs. Please contact me directly if you are interested. Opportunities for funding include:
NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships (e.g., OPP PRFB).

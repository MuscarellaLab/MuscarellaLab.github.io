As an educator, my role is to promote learning in an atmosphere that inspires creativity, interest, and critical thinking. I believe education should go beyond routine memorization and lecture-driven learning, and that students learn best when there is a captivating opportunity to share and discuss new information.

My teaching philosophy is built upon the following:

+ Balancing fundamentals and critical thinking skills
+ Student focused learning outcomes 
+ Modular and flexible lesson plans 
+ Learning through active engagement

# Previous Courses

**Evolution of Molecules and Cells** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2018 <br>
Upper-level undergraduate course that explores the major evolutionary transitions that have shaped life on Earth. Through lectures students are exposed to diverse advanced research areas including molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics, metabolomics, systems biology, and genomics. And through laboratory exercises these topics are reinforced as students use both wet-lab (e.g., RNAi) and computational biology approaches to unravel how genotypes influence an organism's phenotype. 

**Quantitative Biodiversity** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2016 <br>
Graduate-level course that focuses on theory, patterns, metrics, and tools used to study biodiversity. Students calculate diversity metrics, generate and quantify diversity relationships, visualize multivariate data, and conduct phylogenetic tests. Students use modern statistical computing and graphics environments (i.e., R), as well as version control tools (i.e., GitHub). See previous course website for more information.

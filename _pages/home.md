We are broadly interested in the role of microorganisms in the environment and how environmental changes alter the structure and function of microbial communities in natural and host ecosystems. We are interested in how microbial communities respond to changes in local resources (e.g., carbon), and how changing landscapes alter microbial processes. These responses may include differences in community composition, species interactions, functional traits, and ecosystem processes. Our research uses a mixture of field observations, laboratory experimentation, bioinformatics, and theory.
